 * Any Class that requires periodic check on consistency of its states &nbc

 * Some classes require active checks on inconsistent state,
 * this requires keeping an eye on the attributes of the object
 * so as to avoid undesirable state. Any object that requires such
 * check should implement this interface. In addition the class
 * should create an instance of class ScGarbageCollector and set
 * the time period for checks, and start the thread.
 * Thread garbage = new GarbageCollector();
 * gc.setTimeExpired(time) // time in millisecond
 * gc.start();
